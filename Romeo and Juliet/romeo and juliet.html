    <h2 id="ch">Two households both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona,where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands uncleen.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' rage,<br>
        Which but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss,our toil shall strive to mend.<br></h2>
