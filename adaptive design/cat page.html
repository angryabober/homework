        CAT

        <h3>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in<br>
        the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild<br>
        members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely<br>
        ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans<br>
        for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by<br>
        various cat registries.</h3>

        Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp<br>
        teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at<br>
        dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,<br>
        such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark<br>
        (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite<br>
        being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations<br>
        including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.<br>
        [7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.<br>
