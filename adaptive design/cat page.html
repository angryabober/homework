        CAT

        <h3>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in<br>
        the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild<br>
        members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely<br>
        ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans<br>
        for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by<br>
        various cat registries.</h3>

        Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick<br>
        reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators<br>
        who are most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too<br>
        high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.<br>
        Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and<br>
        have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters,<br>
        are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including<br>
        mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body<br>
        language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.<br>

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging<br>
        from two to five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed<br>
        cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying<br>
        and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats<br>
        worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population<br>
        control.
