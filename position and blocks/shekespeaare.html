            <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>

        </div>
        <div class="text"><h3 style="color: rgb(61, 61, 61);">William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet,<br>
            playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language<br>
            and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the<br>
            "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately<br>
            39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of<br>
            uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language<br>
            and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br><br>

            Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age<br>
            of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and<br>
            twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful<br>
            career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the<br>
            Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he<br>
            appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records<br>
            of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation<br>
            about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs,<br>
            and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often<br>
            criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners<br>
            of the period.<br><br>

            Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early<br>
            plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best<br>
            work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among<br>
            them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest<br>
            works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies<br>
            (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.<br><br>

            Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and<br>
            accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of<br>
            Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text<br>
            known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic<br>
            works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem<br>
            by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote<br>
            as "not of an age, but for all time".<br><br>

            Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually<br>
            adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His<br>
            plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various<br>
            cultural and political contexts around the world.<br><br>
